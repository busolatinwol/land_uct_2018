# The Economics of Land Governance (PhD class)
To be taught January 2018 at The University of Cape Town. Sponsored by AERC. 

### Materials for Week 1 (Conning)
### Land property rights, contracts; economic structure, performance and change

This is mostly a skeleton of the site.  Eventually will include PDFs of class slides as well as links to interactive jupyter notebooks and replication files for laboratory exercises.

These are DRAFT materials which will be later finalized.

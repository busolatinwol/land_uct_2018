This will mean that a household that starts with a large endowment of land but only medium farming ability would find it optimal to operate a farm up to a certain scale and then lease out remaining land to the market (because the shadow return to employing land on a yet larger farm would fall below the land rental rate they can get from the market.\n",

It's quite easy to demonstrate that if the initial distribution of skills is distributed as a log-normal then so too will the distribution of optimal farm sizes. Once again the farm household will lease out (lease in) land and hire out (hire in) labor depending on whether their initial holding of the traded land endowment exceeds (falls short of) the optimal land size for their farming skill and whether their initial holding of the traded labor endowment exceeds (falls short of) the optimal labor demand for  their farming skill. \n",

We've shut down the market for supervisory labor whereas they tell a more complicated story about moral hazard which at the end of the day introduces a similar type of diminishing returns to supervision.  That market imperfection by itself is not enough to matter for efficiency in allocation but they then go ahead and introduce a second distortion: they impose the requirement that farms must pay for their land and labor hiring in advance of the crop but then make a farm household's access to capital proportional to it's initial holding of land (they also impose a fixed cost of operation similar to that described above). \n",
